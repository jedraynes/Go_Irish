The premise is that she has a list of high schools in the United States. In each video, she uses a random number generator, finds the high school correspondin to that index/row, and then removes it. At the end, one high school will remain. So, I created a short R script that does just that. Using the dataset she posted, the script randomly removes a high school, appends it to a vector in case you want to see the order your school was removed, prints what school it's removing and the amount of schools remaining, and prints the final school.
